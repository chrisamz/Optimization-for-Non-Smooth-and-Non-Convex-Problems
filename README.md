## Description

The Optimization for Non-Smooth and Non-Convex Problems project aims to implement zero-order nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms for complex optimization tasks. This project focuses on solving challenging optimization problems where traditional gradient-based methods may not be effective.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Stochastic Optimization:** Techniques for optimizing functions that have random elements.
- **Nonsmooth Optimization:** Handling optimization problems where the objective function is not differentiable.
- **Nonconvex Optimization:** Addressing optimization problems with nonconvex objective functions.

## Use Cases

- **Energy Management:** Optimizing energy consumption and distribution in smart grids and buildings.
- **Logistics Optimization:** Enhancing route planning and resource allocation in logistics and supply chain management.
- **Financial Portfolio Management:** Optimizing asset allocation to achieve the best risk-return trade-off.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Energy consumption data, logistics data, financial market data.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.

### 2. Optimization Algorithms

Implement zero-order nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms.

- **Techniques Used:** Random search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch/TensorFlow.

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the optimization algorithms using appropriate metrics.

- **Metrics Used:** Convergence rate, solution quality, computational efficiency.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NumPy, matplotlib.

### 4. Application and Testing

Apply the optimization algorithms to real-world problems and test their performance.

- **Use Cases:** Energy management, logistics optimization, financial portfolio management.
- **Tools Used:** Python, domain-specific libraries (e.g., PyPortfolioOpt for portfolio optimization).
